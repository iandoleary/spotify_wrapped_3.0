# spotify_wrapped_3.0
I built this Power BI report to analyze my personal Spotify user data for the last 8 years or so. I'm a huge music junkie and wanted to dive deeper than just the surface level analytics like "top 5 artists" given in the Spotify wrapped yearly. They instantly gave me back the previous year, but took a month to get back to me with my full listening history. With my 2.0 version I used python and pandas to append and load the JSON into Power BI, but in this one I just uploaded the JSON files directly to Power BI and appended them together there. I haven't yet figured out how I'll host this for the future, so for now I've just included the .pbix file. Overall, really cool project and something I'll do in a few more years once I have more data.

2.0 == 1 year data range

3.0 == full listening history
