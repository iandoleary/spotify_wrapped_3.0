# spotify_wrapped_3.0
I built this Power BI report to analyze my personal Spotify user data for the last 8 years or so. I'm a huge music junkie and wanted to dive deeper than just the surface level analytics such as "top 5 artists" given in the Spotify wrapped yearly. I requested my data from Spotify and they instantly emailed me the previous year's history, but it took about a month to get my full listening history. Spotify sends the data as a bunch of json files, so I just uploaded and appended those together in PowerBI. Overall, really cool project and something I'll do in a few more years once I have more data.

2.0 == 1 year data range

3.0 == full listening history

To request your Spotify listening history, navigate to your account's privacy page, scroll down to "Download your data," select "Extended streaming history," and then request the data.

## Home page<br />

- I wanted to give this more of a website feel, so I added dynamic buttons for page navigation from the main page.

## Wrapped page<br />

- This page displays similar information to the real Spotify wrapped that gets sent to users: top artists, top songs, hours listened, favorite artist, favorite song, etc...
<br />

- Though not my most listened to artist, Pink Floyd is definitely my favorite. Listen to Echoes live in Pompeii and change my mind.
<br />

## Detail page<br />

- I kept some of the visuals from the main page to let the user break things down more dynamically.
- I thought the listens by time of day distribution was really interesting - evidently I'm a bit of a night owl. Those 4 and 5 AM sessions were definitely quarantine.
- Funnily, just about every bucket at the tail end of my song length distribution is Pink Floyd.

- I don't think I've seen any band live more than Glass Animals. HTBAHB, Dreamland, and ZABA are timeless.
<br />

## Behavior page<br />

- This breaks down listens by device, shuffle frequency, plays by location, and some other metrics that aren't necessarily related to music preference.

- These numbers for Switzerland would be much higher if my phone didn't die during my 4 hour 5,000' descent from Mannlichen to Lauterbrunnen. Switzerland is unbelievable and some Dark Side of the Moon would have been great company.
