# spotify_wrapped_3.0
I built this Power BI report to analyze my personal Spotify user data for the last 8 years or so. I'm a huge music junkie and wanted to dive deeper than just the surface level analytics such as "top 5 artists" given in the Spotify wrapped yearly. I requested my data from Spotify and they instantly emailed me the previous year's history, but it took about a month to get my full listening history. Spotify sends the data as a bunch of json files, so I just uploaded and appended those together in PowerBI. Overall, really cool project and something I'll do in a few more years once I have more data.

2.0 == 1 year data range

3.0 == full listening history
